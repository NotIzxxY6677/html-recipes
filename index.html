    <h1> Welcome To NotIzxxY's Modified Recipes</h1>
    <p>So, to start this, I would like to inform everyone that I don't hate any culture or anything, yeah I'm sure the thing probably tastes best as it is in their <em>culture</em>. However, it's to be mentioned these recipes are <strong>MODIFIED</strong> very much to my liking and that's all. Enjoy the delicious recipes.</p>
